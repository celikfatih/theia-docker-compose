## About The Project

This project provides a Docker environment for Theia, an Open, Flexible and Extensible Cloud & Desktop IDE platform. The following tools are provided ready for development in the IDE:

- Go
- Java
- C/C++
- Python2/3
- .NET
- PHP
- Ruby
- Swift
- Dart

## Getting Started

To run locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

To run locally, you must first have `docker` and `docker-compose`.

- [Here's](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) how to download Docker to your local environment.
- [Here's](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) how to download Docker Compose to your local environment.

### Installation

1. First of all, it should be checked that `docker` and `docker-compose` are running.

2. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/celikfatih/theia-docker-compose.git
   ```
3. Specify the values of the parameters in the `.env` file.

   - `WORKING_DIR`: The path where the created project files will be saved (ex: `Users/root/theia-workspace`).
   - `PORT`: Port to use to access Theia IDE.

4. Inside the project, to start jupyter (The `-d` parameter optional and allows it to run in the background):
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
5. If you don't get any error, go to `http://localhost:{PORT}` or `http://127.0.0.1/{PORT}`.

## Usage

If you were able to access the Jupyter Notebook UI when you went to the address, enter your password on the screen.

When you access Jupyter Notebook, check if the `WORKING_DIR` and `DATASET_DIR` you have specified appear on the screen. If a problem does not appear, you can start your work.

By accessing your data from the location you specified, you can do all your work, and your work will also be saved in the location you specified.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add Multi Language Environment
- [x] Add SoftHSM
- [ ] Add Different Languages Support
- [ ] Add different starter packages for Theia IDE.
  - [ ] Spring Tools
  - [ ] Prettier etc.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/celikfatih/theia-docker-compose/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
